# Ask me anything! (Mostly DevOps, Infra, Platform)

## [Ask a question](../../discussions/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read questions](../../discussions)

I get a lot of questions on my LinkedIn, email, and elsewhere. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- If this is about my Udemy courses, best to ask in their Q&A or in the course repository.
- Tech support questions are better asked on Stackovverflow.
- Be civil and polite.
